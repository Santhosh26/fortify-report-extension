Of course. Here is a comprehensive .gitignore file tailored for your project structure and technologies (Node.js, TypeScript, Webpack, VS Code/Azure DevOps Extension).

This file includes the specific items you requested (.vsix, node_modules, dist) and adds other common files and directories that are generated during development and should not be committed to source control.

How to use it:

Create a file named .gitignore in the root of your fortify-report-extension/ directory.

Copy and paste the content above into that file.

Save the file.

Git will now automatically ignore all the specified files and directories.

Explanation of Key Sections:

/node_modules/: Ignores the entire folder where your npm or yarn dependencies are installed. This is crucial as it can be very large and is always re-created by running npm install.

/dist/: Ignores the output directory from your Webpack build process. This contains the final bundled and minified code that the extension will use.

*.vsix: Ignores the final packaged extension file. This is a build artifact, similar to a .zip or .exe, and shouldn't be in source control.

/src/**/*.js and .js.map: This specifically ignores any JavaScript files that might be compiled from your TypeScript (.ts, .tsx) files inside the src directory. This is a safer pattern than just *.js, which would incorrectly ignore your Webpack configuration files.

.vscode/*: Ignores user-specific VS Code settings. The ! lines are exceptions, allowing you to commit shared project settings for debugging (launch.json) or recommended extensions (extensions.json) if your team decides to. You can remove these ! lines if you want to ignore everything in the .vscode directory.

OS-generated files: Ignores common system files created by macOS, Windows, and Linux that don't belong in a repository.
